# Samurai-Typing-Game
This game was my first semester project, developed using Raylib and written in pure C. It turned out better than expected, though itâ€™s still a prototype. While the gameplay may feel limited and repetitive, I plan to remake it in Unity with multiplayer support for a co-op experience and, hopefully, more characters.
