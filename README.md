# Samurai-Typing-Game

## Description
You spawn, stranded, and god knows where. But you have only one clear choice; SURVIVE. Enemies are spawning from all directions, each displaying a letter above them. Type the letter and then press space to defeat them. 

Be careful though, because the enemies are not going to back down either; they merge together to grow their strength and evolve over time to come at you faster and quicker.

Are you ready to challenge yourself? But then again, there are no choices...

SURVIVE.

## Controls 
W/A/S/D    ->     move (you can also use the arrow keys)

+/-    ->    zoom in/out  (on the numpad)

Space    ->    slash enemies

Escape    ->    exit game 

## Background
This game was my first semester project, developed using Raylib and written in pure C. It turned out better than expected, though itâ€™s still a prototype. While the gameplay may feel limited and repetitive, I plan to remake it in Unity with multiplayer support for a co-op experience and, hopefully, more characters.
